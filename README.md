Crypto dashboard

This is a portfolio project written in React which displays up to date information about cryptos and exchanges.
There's a dashboard look and feel to most pages. Design-wise I opted for a clean MUI look.
A self hosted SMTP server was setup to handle Contact emails.
The website is responsive, considering both tablets and phones.
